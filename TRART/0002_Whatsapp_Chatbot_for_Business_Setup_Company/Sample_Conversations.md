## Conversation 1: HOT Lead - Ready to Start E-commerce Business

**Customer:** Hi, I want to start an e-commerce business in Dubai

**Bot:** Hello! Happy to help with your UAE setup 🇦🇪 E-commerce is perfect for a Free Zone setup. May I know your full name and where you're currently based?

**Customer:** I'm Sarah Johnson, currently in London

**Bot:** Great to meet you, Sarah! For e-commerce, will you be selling mainly to UAE customers or internationally?

**Customer:** Mostly international, shipping worldwide

**Bot:** Perfect—Free Zone is ideal for that. It gives you 100% ownership and easy international trade. Tell me a bit more about what you'll be selling?

**Customer:** Designer home decor items, I already have suppliers lined up

**Bot:** That's exciting! A few quick questions: Will you be the sole owner, and how many visas do you need—just yourself or team members too?

**Customer:** Just me for now, I'll need one visa for myself

**Bot:** Got it. For office space—would a virtual office work for now, or do you need a physical space?

**Customer:** Virtual office is fine, I'll work remotely

**Bot:** Smart approach. Do you have an estimated budget? For example: under AED 15,000, AED 15,000–25,000, or above AED 30,000?

**Customer:** Around 20,000 AED is fine for me

**Bot:** That works perfectly. When would you like to start—immediately, within the next month, or just exploring?

**Customer:** I want to start immediately, I have everything ready

**Bot:** Excellent! Do you plan to get a residence visa through your company?

**Customer:** Yes, I want to move to Dubai

**Bot:** Perfect. Do you already have your passport copy and a proposed company name ready?

**Customer:** Yes, I have my passport ready. Company name is "Luxe Home Decor FZE"

**Bot:** Love that name! Based on your answers, I recommend starting with a Free Zone e-commerce setup. It offers 100% ownership, easy international trade, and costs around AED 18,000–22,000 including license and visa. We can have your trade license ready in 5-7 working days once documents are submitted. Would you like me to prepare your official quotation and next steps?

**Customer:** Yes please, send me the quotation

**Bot:** Fantastic! I'll have our team prepare a detailed quotation with the document checklist and send it to you shortly. Someone will reach out within 2 hours to finalize everything. You're on track to have your business up and running very soon! 🚀

## Conversation 2: WARM Lead - Consulting Business, Needs Information

**Customer:** Hello, I'm thinking about starting a consulting business in UAE

**Bot:** Hello! Happy to help with your UAE setup 🇦🇪 What type of consulting are you planning to offer?

**Customer:** Business strategy consulting for tech companies

**Bot:** That's great! Will your main clients be inside the UAE or internationally?

**Customer:** Mix of both, some local UAE clients and some international

**Bot:** Got it. For that mix, we have options for both Mainland (local trade) and Free Zone (international). May I know your name and where you're currently based?

**Customer:** I'm Ahmed Al Mazrouei, based in Abu Dhabi

**Bot:** Nice to meet you, Ahmed! Will you be the sole owner, or do you have partners involved?

**Customer:** Just me, sole owner

**Bot:** Perfect. How many visas do you expect to need—just yourself, or team members and family as well?

**Customer:** I already have UAE residency through my current employer. I might need 1-2 visas for team members later

**Bot:** Makes sense. Do you need a physical office or would a virtual office / flexi-desk work for now?

**Customer:** I think flexi-desk is fine to start

**Bot:** Smart approach, you can always upgrade. Do you have an estimated budget? For example: under AED 15,000, AED 15,000–25,000, or above AED 30,000?

**Customer:** What's the difference in pricing between Mainland and Free Zone?

**Bot:** Good question! Free Zone setup is around AED 15,000–22,000 with flexi-desk and includes 100% ownership. Mainland is around AED 25,000–30,000+ and lets you trade anywhere in UAE without restrictions. Since you have both local and international clients, either could work—Free Zone is more budget-friendly to start, Mainland gives you more flexibility for local contracts.

**Customer:** I see. I'm not sure which one yet. What if I need to change later?

**Bot:** Totally understand. Most consultants in your situation start with Free Zone because it's faster and more affordable, then add a Mainland license later if needed. You can operate both. When are you looking to start—immediately, within the next month, or still exploring?

**Customer:** Probably in about a month, I need to give notice at my current job

**Bot:** Makes sense. I can send you a free proposal outlining both Free Zone and Mainland options with detailed costs and process—that way you'll have clear details to review while you're wrapping up your current role. Would that be helpful?

**Customer:** Yes, that would be great

**Bot:** Perfect! I'll have our team prepare a comprehensive proposal comparing both options and send it to you shortly. Take your time to review, and we'll be here when you're ready to move forward 💼

## Conversation 3: COLD Lead - Early Research, Budget Concerns

**Customer:** How much does it cost to start a business in Dubai?

**Bot:** Hello! Interested in setting up a business in the UAE? Costs typically range from AED 12,000 to AED 30,000+ depending on your business type and needs. What type of business are you thinking about?

**Customer:** Maybe a small trading company

**Bot:** Got it. Trading what specifically—products, goods, or services?

**Customer:** Not sure yet, just looking at options

**Bot:** That's completely fine! Are you thinking about selling mainly in the UAE or internationally?

**Customer:** Probably local UAE market

**Bot:** Makes sense. For local UAE trading, Mainland setup works best—costs around AED 25,000–30,000 including license and visa. May I know where you're currently based?

**Customer:** I'm in Pakistan

**Bot:** Great! Will you need a residence visa to live in UAE, or planning to manage remotely?

**Customer:** I want to come to Dubai but that seems expensive

**Bot:** I understand—the good news is we can start small with a flexi-desk package and upgrade later once your business grows. This keeps your first-year cost low while securing your business license and residency. For example, Free Zone trading starts around AED 15,000 with visa included.

**Customer:** Still seems like a lot for me

**Bot:** What budget range are you working with?

**Customer:** Maybe 5000-7000 AED

**Bot:** I appreciate you sharing that. Unfortunately, that budget won't cover a full UAE company setup with license and visa—the minimum from any legitimate authority is around AED 12,000-15,000. However, there might be alternative structures we could explore. This needs our senior consultant to discuss specific options with you. Someone from our team can reach out to explore what might work for your situation—would that be helpful?

**Customer:** Let me think about it and do more research first

**Bot:** No worries at all—take your time to explore. When you're ready or have more questions, we're here to help. We can also send you information outlining the realistic options and costs so you have clear details for your research. Would you like that?

**Customer:** Maybe later, thanks

**Bot:** Sounds good! Feel free to reach out anytime. Good luck with your research 🇦🇪

## Conversation 4: HOT Lead - Voice Message (Audio Transcription Flow)

**Customer:** *[Sends voice message]* "Hi, I want to start a tech company in Dubai Free Zone. I need it done fast, I have investors ready. Can you help?"

**Bot:** *[Voice response sent back]* "Hello! Absolutely, I can help you set up your tech company in a Free Zone quickly. For investor-backed tech companies, we can have everything ready in 5-7 working days. May I know your name and a bit more about what your tech company will do?"

**Customer:** My name is Michael Chen. We're building a SaaS platform for logistics

**Bot:** Excellent, Michael! SaaS in Free Zone is perfect. How many founders/investors are involved, and how many visas will you need?

**Customer:** 2 founders, we need 3 visas total initially

**Bot:** Got it. Do you need a physical office or would a flexi-desk setup work to start?

**Customer:** We need a small office, not just virtual

**Bot:** Makes sense for a tech team. What's your setup budget? For example: under AED 25,000, AED 25,000–40,000, or above AED 40,000?

**Customer:** Budget is around 35,000 AED, we need to move fast

**Bot:** Perfect, that budget works well. Do you and your co-founder need residence visas through the company?

**Customer:** Yes, both of us need residence visas

**Bot:** Great. Based on your needs—SaaS tech company, 2 founders, 3 visas, small office, AED 35K budget—I recommend a Free Zone setup (likely DMCC or DTEC for tech). Cost will be around AED 32,000–38,000 including licenses, 3 visas, and shared office space. Setup time: 5-7 working days. Would you like me to prepare your official quotation and next steps?

**Customer:** Yes, send it ASAP. Do you also help with corporate bank accounts?

**Bot:** Absolutely! We assist with corporate bank account opening as well. I'll have our senior consultant reach out within 2 hours to prepare your detailed quotation, document checklist, and banking support options. You're in good hands! 🚀

## Conversation 5: WARM Lead - Restaurant Business, Exploring Options

**Customer:** I want to open a restaurant in Dubai

**Bot:** Hello! Happy to help with your UAE setup 🇦🇪 Restaurant business is exciting! What type of cuisine or concept are you planning?

**Customer:** Middle Eastern fusion restaurant

**Bot:** That sounds amazing! May I know your name and where you're currently based?

**Customer:** I'm Fatima Hassan, currently in Cairo

**Bot:** Great to meet you, Fatima! For restaurants, you'll need a Mainland license since you're serving local customers. Will you be the sole owner, or do you have partners?

**Customer:** I have one business partner

**Bot:** Got it—so you'll set up as an LLC with 2 partners. How many visas do you expect to need for yourself, your partner, and any key team members?

**Customer:** We'll need visas for the 2 of us, plus maybe 3-4 for chef and managers

**Bot:** Makes sense. Do you already have a location in mind, or are you still searching for the right space?

**Customer:** Still looking for location

**Bot:** That's fine—we can start the company setup process while you search. The license comes first, then you finalize the location. Do you have an estimated budget for the company setup (not including restaurant fit-out)? For example: AED 25,000–40,000, or above AED 40,000?

**Customer:** What does that budget cover exactly?

**Bot:** Good question! For restaurant Mainland setup, budget covers: trade license from DED, 5-6 residence visas, initial approvals, and office registration requirements. It does NOT include your actual restaurant space lease, fit-out, or equipment—those are separate. Setup typically costs AED 35,000–45,000 depending on visa count.

**Customer:** That's higher than I expected. Can we do it cheaper?

**Bot:** I understand. Restaurant licensing has specific requirements from Dubai Municipality and food safety authorities, which makes it one of the more involved setups. We can start with minimum visas (just 2 for you and partner) and add more later—that brings it closer to AED 30,000-35,000. Would that work better?

**Customer:** Maybe. I need to discuss with my partner first

**Bot:** Totally understand—this is a big decision. I can send you a detailed proposal outlining the full setup process, costs breakdown, timeline, and requirements so you and your partner can review together. Would that be helpful?

**Customer:** Yes, please send that

**Bot:** Perfect! I'll have our team prepare a comprehensive restaurant setup proposal and send it to you. Take your time to review with your partner, and we're here when you're ready to move forward 💼
