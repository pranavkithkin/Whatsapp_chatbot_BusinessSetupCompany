Hello 👋, thank you for your interest in starting a business in the UAE!
May I please know your full name and where you’re currently based?
Purpose: Build rapport and personalize the conversation.

“What type of business are you planning to start in the UAE?”
Purpose: Identify activity category (commercial, service, industrial, etc.).

“Will your main customers be inside the UAE or internationally?”
Purpose: Determines whether to recommend Mainland (local trade) or Free Zone (international).

“Can you tell me a bit more about what your business will actually do — for example, are you offering a service, selling products, or managing an online platform?”
Purpose: To match the activity with available Free Zone or DED categories.

“Will you be the sole owner, or will you have partners or investors involved?”
Purpose: Determines company type (FZE, FZCO, LLC, etc.).

“How many visas do you expect to need — just for yourself, or for your team and family as well?”
Purpose: Determines visa quota, office requirements, and package size.

“Do you need a physical office or warehouse, or would a virtual office / flexi-desk work for now?”
Purpose: Helps recommend the right Free Zone or Mainland setup.

“Do you have an estimated budget for your company setup?
(For example: under AED 15,000, AED 15,000–25,000, or above AED 30,000.)”
Purpose: To match client with a realistic package (Free Zone vs. Mainland).

“When would you like to start the process — immediately, within the next month, or just exploring for now?”
Purpose: To gauge urgency and sales priority.

“Do you plan to live in the UAE and get a residence visa through your company?”
Purpose: Determines whether to include visa processing in quotation.

“Would you also like to bring your spouse or family members under your visa later on?”
Purpose: Helps upsell visa services and highlight family benefits.

“Do you already have your passport copy and a proposed company name ready?”
Purpose: To determine how soon documentation can begin.

“Would you like assistance with opening a corporate bank account in the UAE as well?”
Purpose: Cross-sell banking support.

“So just to confirm — your goal is to [summarize client’s plan], targeting [local/international] clients, and starting within [timeframe]. Correct?”
Purpose: Summarize and confirm understanding before making a recommendation.

“Based on your answers, I recommend starting with a [Free Zone / Mainland] setup.
It offers [reason: 100% ownership / local trade / flexibility] and costs around AED [X]–[Y] including visa and license.
Would you like me to prepare your official quotation and next steps?”
Purpose: Transition smoothly into closing.

If client says “I’m just researching”
“That’s completely fine! I can send you a free proposal outlining your best options, costs, and process — that way you’ll have clear details when you’re ready.”

If client says “It’s too expensive”
“I understand — the good news is we can start small with a flexi-desk package and upgrade later once your business grows.
This keeps your first-year cost low while securing your business license and residency.”

If client says “I’ll decide later”
“No worries — we can reserve your company name today at no extra charge. That holds your preferred name and locks in this year’s pricing for 30 days.”

“Would you like me to send you the quotation and document checklist to start your company setup?
We can have your trade license ready in as little as 5 working days once documents are submitted.”
